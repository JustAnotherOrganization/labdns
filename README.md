# labdns

A mostly simple daemon and client for automatically updating DNS settings to point
to a dynamically configured host IP address.

## Do you want to use this or external-dns

The exernal-dns project is awesome for kubernetes clusters but so far as I have found so far is not worth the effort for a single node or bare metal system. It's the latter case that labdns is designed for.
